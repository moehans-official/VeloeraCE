In an era of multiple AI models coexisting, Veloera CE aims to address the pain points of API integration fragmentation. It serves as a relay bridge between the application layer and underlying model providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, ERNIE Bot, etc.), providing unified standard interfaces, load balancing, and resource monitoring capabilities.
